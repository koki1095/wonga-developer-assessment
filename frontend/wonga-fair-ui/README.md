A full-stack authentication application built with React, C# .NET 10.0, and PostgreSQL, containerized with Docker.

## Live Demo Features

- **User Registration** with form validation
- **Secure Login** with JWT authentication
- **Protected Dashboard** showing user details
- **Loan Calculator** with interactive sliders
- **Thank You Modal** demonstrating UI/UX polish

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios |
| **Backend** | C# .NET 10.0 Web API, Entity Framework Core, JWT, BCrypt |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 |
| **Containerization** | Docker & Docker Compose |
| **Testing** | xUnit (Unit Tests) |

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, containerized microservices architecture:

Frontend ────▶ :3000 
Backend ────▶ :8080
Database ────▶ :5432 

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers with email/password
2. Password is hashed using BCrypt and stored in PostgreSQL
3. User logs in with credentials
4. Server validates and returns JWT token
5. Token is stored in localStorage and included in subsequent requests
6. Protected routes/endpoints validate the token before granting access

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### Protected Endpoints (JWT Required)
- GET /api/user/me` - Get current user details

## Running with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (24.0+)
- Docker Compose (2.20+)

### Quick Start

cd wonga-developer-assessment

# Start all services
docker-compose up --build
Access the Application
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api

4. API Testing (without Swagger)
bash
# Register a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'


# Run backend unit tests
cd backend
dotnet test
